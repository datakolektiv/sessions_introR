## Overview
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Data Science in the programming language R for those who want to get a grasp on the contemporary approach to analytics, statistics, and machine learning as well as its application - but do not necessarily have a technical background in coding, computer science, or statistics. This is a practical course which provides a minimal but explicable and useful theoretical foundation for those who want to enter Data Science from a (mainly) non-technical perspective and still become able to work efficiently in its highly technical context.

This is planned as you first course in Data Science and it still provides a practical, working knowledge that you can rely on to build research and analytics projects on your own.

Most important of all: you are motivated to learn Data Science in R. If you want it, you want it – and you will work hard to win it. And if you are motivated and prepared to invest hard work, we guarantee success.

We will support you in anything that needs to be done during the course in any of the following operative systems: Windows, Linux Ubuntu/Debian, and macOS. If any of the projects that you would like to develop during the course need rely on heavy computations and/or memory use, we will provide the technical infrastructure to you and teach you how to manage it (up to 128GB of RAM, half TB (that would be 500 GB) of SSD storage, and up to 24 AMD cores for computation).

## GOALS
We want to help you to learn how to learn. The landscape of contemporary Data Science is truly a universe on its own, and no one manages to know it all: it is a world meant for those with curiosity and courage, armed with readiness to explore, learn, unlearn, and relearn. We want to help you to acquire the necessary coding skills together with a practical understanding of the fundamental concepts and principles. Thus only you will be able to put your curiosity to work and start exploring and specializing in Data Science without needing anyone to guide you but yourself. Near the end of this course we expect you to be already able to develop and manage a Data Science project on your own.

## OVERVIEW
We begin with simple guides on how to install the necessary (free and open source) software on your machine. You will be using RStudio, a powerful Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R, a nice piece of software which will make your work as comfortable and efficient as possible. RStudio is free and easy to install and manage.

Then we will teach you – very patiently – to write computer programs in the programming language R, the lingua franca of the contemporary Data Science, one step at the time. Even the very first programs that you will be writing encompass operations that are highly typical and important in Data Science.

In the following steps, we introduce mathematical concepts of probability, vector and matrix arithmetic, of essential importance in your future work. We provide a highly non-technical, conceptual introduction to the mathematical apparatus, with a plenty of examples for you to study and understand. Each time a new concept is introduced we study and exercise its representation and operation in the programming language R.

We provide an overview of where the data live in this World and how to get to them from R, an overview of all popular data formats and how to work with them, and focus a lot on data wrangling, a process in which Data Scientists clean and reshape their datasets in order to make them suitable for analytics, modeling, and visualization. In a very important chapter we learn how to work with strings and text in R and provide an introduction to regular expressions to process, clean, and correct textual information. We rely on a set of R packages jointly known as tidyverse, of course: it is a powerful standard to manage data in R that Data Scientist are very happy to use.

In the next step you will start producing your first analytics: data overviews, summaries, aggregates, and visualizations. We start introducing the framework of statistical testing and build together your first numerical simulations. The simulations will help you build an essential understanding of probability theory and the behavior of random variables. We will then focus on producing industry standard static visualizations in the R {ggplot2} package, carefully inspecting all important approaches to visual data representation and when to use them.

With the knowledge that you have gathered thus far, you will start building you first models, while being introduced to the essential concepts of learning error, optimization, cross-validation, regularization, and many more. Again, all mathematical concepts are introduced and explained in a highly non-technical manner, and we provide careful guidance while you build your understanding directly by applying each of them. We will go into the details of linear (simple and multiple) and logistic regression (binomial and multinomial) to learn how to deal with simple prediction and classification problems, and then study decision trees and random forests to be able to manage more difficult problems.

Finally, we will help you build your first Data Products, interactive reports with R Markdown that can be served as web-pages to your future clients and collaborators, supported by dynamic, interactive visualizations with Plotly. We will also show how to to build interactive maps and networks and serve them in your nicely designed reports. You will learn how to build a website in R Markdown in simple ways and serve as many reports from there as you need – so that you can start acting like an analytics firm on its own in no time at all.

## COURSE CURRICULUM
The course takes 24 weeks (approximately six months) to complete. We expect you to be able to invest 6 – 8 hours of your time weekly. Each week we will organize a two to three hours lab and meet do learn and discuss new things. Ad hoc 1:1 sessions will be organized. The rest of the expected work is guided exercise, Q&A, labs, and independent project development. All learning material, code and exercises will be provided in a timely manner. If you choose to develop your own Data Science project in this course, support to work with the Git/GitHub version-control system will be provided to you.
