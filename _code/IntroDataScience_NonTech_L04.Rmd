### What do we want to do today?

We want to provide an overview of the `apply` family of functions in R and focus on their similarities and differences. 

### 1. `lapply() and sapply()`

Let's create a vector of 100 uniformly distributed random numbers on the [0, 1] interval:

```{r echo = T}
unifs <- runif(n = 100, min = 0, max = 1)
head(unifs)
```

We can find out which elements in `unifs` are `> .5` by a simple R expression:

```{r echo = T}
probable <- unifs > .5
sum(probable)
```

But we can do the same from `lapply()`:

```{r echo = T}
probable <- lapply(unifs, function(x) {x > .5})
head(probable)
```

Except for now `probable` is a list - because `lapply()` returns a list by design. We want a vector; two ways to go, first is to  use `unlist()`:

```{r echo = T}
probable <- unlist(lapply(unifs, function(x) {x > .5}))
head(probable)
```

`unlist()` is easy:

```{r echo = T}
a <- list(a = 5, 
          b = 10, 
          c = 17)
unlist(a)
```

`unlist()` will automatically convert a named list to a named vector, as we can see; beware of the implicit type conversion in R:

```{r echo = T}
a <- list(a = "5", 
          b = 10, 
          c = 17)
unlist(a)
```

The other way to obtain a vector in place of a list is to use the `sapply()` function:

```{r echo = T}
probable <- sapply(unifs, function(x) {x > .5})
head(probable)
```

`sapply()` will try to simplify the `lapply()` result whenever it is possible to do so. Since our input was very simple - a vector of random numbers - the output was also very simple - a list with each element representing a single `logical` value - `sapply()` was able to complete the task exactly as expected.

However, you need to be careful when using `sapply()`. Let's implement a slightly more complicated function:

```{r echo = T}
probable_57 <- sapply(unifs, function(x) {
  point_5 <- x > .5
  point_75 <- x > .75
  return(c(point_5, 
           point_75))
  })
head(probable_57)
```

`sapply()` has returned the result as a matrix:

```{r echo = T}
class(probable_57)
```

```{r echo = T}
dim(probable_57)
```

The result of the `point_5 <- x > .5` call from the function are found in the first row, while the results of the `point_75 <- x > .75` call from the function are found in the second row.

### 2. `mapply() and Map()`

Let's now turn to `mapply()` and `Map()`. We have already seen `Map()` in action, e.g:

```{r echo = T}
v1 <- 1:10
v2 <- seq(2, 20, by = 2)
exps <- Map("^", v1, v2)
print(exps)
```

A list of results is returned, as in `lapply()`. We can `unlist()` that, of course:

```{r echo = T}
exps <- unlist(Map("^", v1, v2))
print(exps)
```

Now, we can accomplish exactly the same with `laplly()` or `sapply()` by rewriting our code in the following way:

```{r echo = T}
l <- Map(list, v1, v2)
exps <- unlist(
  lapply(l, function(x) {
    x[[1]]^x[[2]]
  })
)
print(exps)
```

What have I done? I have first used `Map()` to create a list of pairs of lists, each element in the pair coming first from `v1` and then from `v2`, look:

```{r echo = T}
l <- Map(list, v1, v2)
head(l)
```

And then `lapply()` to compute:

```{r echo = T}
exps <- unlist(
  lapply(l, function(x) {
    x[[1]]^x[[2]]
  })
)
print(exps)
```

Because `lapply()` takes a vector (or a list, but list is a vector) as its input, I can use only `function(x)` of one argument; I have created a list of lists so that I can compute `x[[1]]^x[[2]]` in the function call.

And of course I could have used `sapply()` to simplify the result:

```{r echo = T}
exps <- sapply(l, function(x) {
    x[[1]]^x[[2]]
  })
print(exps)
```

Another way to accomplish the same and avoid creating a list of lists to pass to `lapply()` or `sapply()` was to create a 2D array - a matrix - and pass it to `apply()`:

```{r echo = T}
v <- cbind(v1, v2)
print(v)
```

```{r echo = T}
apply(v, 1, function(x) {
  x[1]^x[2]
})
```

Remember: the second argument to `apply()` - `1` in this example - specifies the array dimension across which `function(x)` will operate; `1` for rows, `2` for columns, etc.

Now, what is `mapply()`? We did not use this function before. Its relationship to `Map()` is similar to the relationship of `sapply()` to `mapply()`. 

While `Map()` returns a list...

```{r echo = T}
l <- Map(list, v1, v2)
head(l)
```
... `mapply()` tries to simplify:

```{r echo = T}
l <- mapply(list, v1, v2)
head(l)
```

`Map()` is really just a wrapper around `mapply()`; you can pass a `SIMPLIFY` argument to it set to either `TRUE` or `FALSE`, look:

```{r echo = T}
l <- mapply(list, v1, v2, SIMPLIFY = FALSE)
head(l)
```

So `Map()` is really just the same as `mapply(fun, fun_arguments, SIMPLIFY = TRUE)`.


### R Markdown

[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is what I have used to produce this beautiful Notebook. We will learn more about it near the end of the course, but if you already feel ready to dive deep, here's a book: [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide, Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, Garrett Grolemunds.](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)
