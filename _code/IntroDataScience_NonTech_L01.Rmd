### What do we want to do today?

We will learn more about regular expressions and string processing in R. Please take into your consideration that regular expressions are indeed complicated and in that fact it takes a course on its own in order to master them completely. Here we will cover only some elementary applications of regular expressions that are useful in simple data cleaning operations.

### 1. Regular expressions

**Please** consider this piece of documentation seriously: [regex](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/regex) 

#### 1.1 Introduction: `grepl()`, `grep()`, and `regexpr()`

Let's begin by reviewing what we have already learned: `grepl()`

```{r echo = T}
strings <- c("hyperplane", "airplane", "filter", "dplyr", "plane")
grepl(pattern = "plane", x = strings)
```
The base R function `grepl()` asks us to define a `pattern` - which is a regex - and then to provide a value for the `x` argument which is a *string* (or a vector of strings, as in this example) in which we want to look for the `pattern`. Our first example is very simple: we ask if `"plane"` is present in `"hyperplane"`, `"airplane"`, `"filter"`, `"dplyr"`, or `"plane"`, and the result is of course: `TRUE`, `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `FALSE`, ` TRUE`.

What about the following:

```{r echo = T}
strings <- c("hyperplane", "airplane", "filter", "dplyr", "plane")
grepl(pattern = "Plane", x = strings)
```
Well, of course: `"Plane"` is simply not the same as `"plane"`. Now, `grepl()` has another argument that we did not use before, `ignore.case`. It is a logical one:

```{r echo = T}
strings <- c("hyperplane", "airplane", "filter", "dplyr", "plane")
grepl(pattern = "Plane", x = strings, ignore.case = TRUE)
```

Enter regular expressions: remember that `^` represents the beginning of the string?

```{r echo = T}
strings <- c("hyperplane", "airplane", "filter", "dplyr", "plane")
grepl(pattern = "^plane", x = strings, ignore.case = TRUE)
```
and of course only `"plane"` in `strings` begins with `"plane"`. 

What elements of the `strings` character vector end with `plane`? We have already seen in this course that as `^` represents the empty character at the beginning of the string there is `$` that represents the empty character at the *end of the string*:

```{r echo = T}
strings <- c("hyperplane", "airplane", "filter", "dplyr", "plane")
grepl(pattern = "plane$", x = strings, ignore.case = TRUE)
```
Besides `grepl()` we also have `grep()` in base R:

```{r echo = T}
strings <- c("hyperplane", "airplane", "filter", "dplyr", "plane")
grep(pattern = "plane", x = strings)
```
Unlike `grepl()` that returns a logical vector, `grep()` returns the indices of `x` where the pattern is found. For example:

```{r echo = T}
strings <- c("hyperplane", "airplane", "filter", "dplyr", "plane")
grep(pattern = "^plane", x = strings)
```
Or:

```{r echo = T}
strings <- c("hyperplane", "airplane", "filter", "dplyr", "plane")
grep(pattern = "plane$", x = strings)
```
But we can also ask for the values from `grep()`:

```{r echo = T}
strings <- c("hyperplane", "airplane", "filter", "dplyr", "plane")
grep(pattern = "plane$", x = strings, value = T)
```
Another important base R function to work with regular expressions is `regexpr()`.

```{r echo = T}
strings <- c("hyperplane", "airplane", "filter", "dplyr", "plane")
regexpr(pattern = "plane", text = strings)
```
Please disregard the `useBytes` and `index.type` attributes for now. What is interesting here is the function output and the  `match.length` attribute. The value that the function returns is the position where `pattern` begins in each element of `text` in which the `pattern` is actually found, with `-1` indicating that the pattern was not found indeed:

```{r echo = T}
strings <- c("hyperplane", "airplane", "filter", "dplyr", "plane")
foundWhere <- regexpr(pattern = "plane", text = strings)
foundWhere[1]
```
This means that the `pattern` was found to begin in the 6h position of the first element of `text`, which is: "hyperplane". What was the length of the pattern found?

```{r echo = T}
strings <- c("hyperplane", "airplane", "filter", "dplyr", "plane")
foundWhere <- regexpr(pattern = "plane", text = strings)
attr(foundWhere, 'match.length')[1]
```
Now this you have not seen before. R objects have *attributes*, and the attributes are accessed via the `attr()` function. In this case, `attr(foundWhere, 'match.length')[1]` asks for the first value of the `match.length` attribute of the `foundWhere` object.

This is how we find where patterns begin and end in strings in base R, look:

```{r echo = T}
strings <- c("hyperplane", "airplane", "filter", "dplyr", "plane")
foundWhere <- regexpr(pattern = "plane", text = strings)
start <- foundWhere[1]
end <- attr(foundWhere, 'match.length')[1]
cat(
  paste0('"plane" is found in "',
         strings[1],
         '" beginning in the ',
         start, 'th position and ending in the ',
         start+end-1, 'th position'))
```
and it follows that the value of `'match.length'` attribute corresponds to the value of the `pattern` that we were looking for!

**Hint:** study what `gregexpr()` does in base R + learn about the difference between `print()` and `cat()` in R.

#### 1.2 Regex, seriously

We understand the meaning of `^` and `$` in regex already. Now we want to learn about the meaning of `+`, `*`, `.`, `[`, `]`, and `|`.

Imagine that we are facing the task to analyze some aspect of a system that encompasses user names of the following form:

```{r echo = T}
userID <-  "Maria0001449"
grepl("0001449", userID)
```
Of course. However, what if the system imposes the following rule: a user name must begin with the user's real name, followed by *any* number of digits?

See:

```{r echo = T}
userID <-  "Maria0001449"
grepl("[0123456789]+$", userID)
```
What we find in between `[` and `]` is a character class: it matches *any* character found in it. What `+` means is: the previous character - or a character class, in our example - is found *once or more than once*. So, the semantics of `[0123456789]+$` is exactly the following one:

- *any* of `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9` is found,
- and it is repeated (hint: `+`) once or more than once, and then 
- the string ends (hint: `$`).

What if the system has the following rule for user names: a user name must begin with the user's real name, followed *or not* by *any* number of digits?

```{r echo = T}
userID <-  "Maria0001449"
grepl("[0123456789]*$", userID)
```
Ok, but also:


```{r echo = T}
userID <-  "Maria"
grepl("[0123456789]*$", userID)
```
Because in regular expressions `*` means: the previous repeats **zero** or as many times!

So, `+` and `*` are *quantifiers` in regular expressions. Again, character classes:


```{r echo = T}
string <-  "ABCDE"
grepl("[Y|I|O]", string)
```
What is `|`? Let' see:

```{r echo = T}
string <-  "ABCDE"
grepl("[Y|A|O]", string)
```
```{r echo = T}
string <-  "ABCDE"
grepl("[Y|9|O]", string)
```
```{r echo = T}
string <-  "ABCDE"
grepl("[D|E|0]", string)
```
So `|` means: **logical OR** :)

The following one: `.` is dangerous. The `.` means: **just anything**:

```{r echo = T}
string <-  "ABCDE"
grepl(".", string)
```
And it is, of course, found everywhere:

```{r echo = T}
string <-  "ABCDE"
gregexpr(".", string)
```
So what if we need to recognize `.` literally in a string? Well, we have to escape it:

```{r echo = T}
string <-  "Goran.S.Milovanovic"
gregexpr("\.", string)
```
No, no... This is what we need:

```{r echo = T}
string <-  "Goran.S.Milovanovic"
gregexpr("\\.", string)
```
And yes `.` is found in the sixth and eighth position in `Goran.S.Milovanovic`!

Why the double backslash: `\\`? Because the backslash escapes in R, but in regex also, of course, so we need to inform R that what follows the first `\` needs to be interpreted not as some special character but literally as what it is, and then the second `\` informs the regex engine that what follows it - and that would be `.` - should be escaped, i.e. not interpreted as `anything` (regex semantics) but as the `.` character literally. 

Complicated? You will get used to it, do not worry... Remember that Data Science is the sexiest profession of the 21st century. Well is it not? :)

Look:

```{r echo = T}
string <-  "Goran.S.Milovanovic0528$@3674"
grepl("[[:alpha:]]+\\.[[:alpha:]]\\.[[:alpha:]]+.+", string)
```
`[[:alpha:]]+\\.[[:alpha:]]\\.[[:alpha:]]+.+` means: 

- a letter (`[[:alpha:]]`),
- occurring once or more than once (`+`), is followed by 
- a dot (`\\.`), followed by 
- a single letter (`[[:alpha:]]`), followed by
- a dot (`\\.`), followed by 
- a letter (`[[:alpha:]]`),
- occurring once or more than once (`+`), followed by
- just anything repeated once or more than once (`.+`).

What is `[[:alpha:]]`?

#### 1.3 Predefined character classes

From the [Regex: Regular Expressions As Used In R documentation page](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/regex): 

> Certain named classes of characters are predefined.

``` {}
[:alnum:]
Alphanumeric characters: [:alpha:] and [:digit:].

[:alpha:]
Alphabetic characters: [:lower:] and [:upper:].

[:blank:]
Blank characters: space and tab, and possibly other locale-dependent characters such as non-breaking space.

[:cntrl:]
Control characters. In ASCII, these characters have octal codes 000 through 037, and 177 (DEL). In another character set, these are the equivalent characters, if any.

[:digit:]
Digits: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.

[:graph:]
Graphical characters: [:alnum:] and [:punct:].

[:lower:]
Lower-case letters in the current locale.

[:print:]
Printable characters: [:alnum:], [:punct:] and space.

[:punct:]
Punctuation characters: ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ \ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~.

[:space:]
Space characters: tab, newline, vertical tab, form feed, carriage return, space and possibly other locale-dependent characters.

[:upper:]
Upper-case letters in the current locale.

[:xdigit:]
Hexadecimal digits: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F a b c d e f.
```

**Q.** Ok, but why the double square brackets, like in: `[[:alpha:]]`?

**A.** Because `[` and `]` in `[:alpha:]` are simply a part of the predefined name, and we still want to inform the regex engine that we mean: *a character class*.

#### 1.4 Backreferences and `gsub()`

Did we mention `gsub()` in the past? I think we already did:

```{r echo = T}
string <-  "New York City"
gsub("New", "Old", string)
```
Ok. Now what if I would like to change *each* occurrence of `#err` to an empty string `""` in the following: 

```{r echo = T}
string <-  "someDatabas#erreRecordGoneWrong"
gsub("#err", "", string)
```
Great. Now we know how to delete things that we do not need in strings. 

Now, the *backreferences* in regex with `gsub()`. Imagine that we are facing the following situation: 

```{r echo = T}
strings <- c("NewYork", "NewAmsterdam", "NewBelgrade")
print(strings)
```
Obviously, a set of typos, all missing a white space, which can be fixed in the following way:

```{r echo = T}
gsub("(New)", "\\1 ", strings)
```
`\\1` in this example is a **backreference** which refers to the *first* parenthesized expression in the pattern `"(New)"`; it will be replaced by itself concatenated with a white space - `"\\1 "` in `gsub()`! Let's elaborate; in

```
gsub(pattern, replacement, x)
```

we have used `"(New)"` as a `pattern`, and `"\\1 "` as a `replacement`, where `strings` played a role of `x`: the `replacement` used `\\1` as a backreference to `(New)` in the `pattern` argument `"(New)"`.




### Further Readings

- Once again: [Gaston Sanchez's "Handling and Processing Strings in R"](http://gastonsanchez.com/Handling_and_Processing_Strings_in_R.pdf) - the chances you will ever need more than what's covered in this text-book are slim.

- **Regular Expressions**: go pro. [Regular-Expressions.info](http://www.regular-expressions.info/) is a well known learning resource. In order to figure out the specific regex standard used in R: [Regular Expressions as used in R](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/regex.html). [This section of Regular-Expressions.info](http://www.regular-expressions.info/rlanguage.html) is on regex in R specifically.


### R Markdown

[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is what I have used to produce this beautiful Notebook. We will learn more about it near the end of the course, but if you already feel ready to dive deep, here's a book: [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide, Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, Garrett Grolemunds.](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)
