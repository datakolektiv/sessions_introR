### What do we want to do today?

We will simulate correlated variables and perform tons of linear regressions to inspect the distributions of linear coefficients and understand what is the standard error of the coefficient in linear regression. 

### 0. Setup

```{r echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(MASS)
set.seed(9988)
```

### 1. Simulate correlated variables from a Multivariate Normal Distribution

Random draws from the [Multivariate Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution) in R can be performed with `MASS:mvrnorm()`. In the following chunk, `meansVector` defines a vector of the two variables' means, and `covMat` is their variance-covariance matrix:

```{r echo = T}
meansVector <- c(15, 25)
print(meansVector)
```

```{r echo = T}
covMat <- matrix(
  c(0.6856935, 
    1.274315, 
    1.2743154, 
    3.116278),
  nrow = 2
  )
print(covMat)
```
The covariance between the two variables is set to be `1.274315`.
Let's take a sample of size `150` from the Multivariate Normal Distribution defined from `meansVector` and `covMat`: 

```{r echo = T}
mvn_sample <- as.data.frame(mvrnorm(n = 150,
                                    mu = meansVector,
                                    Sigma = covMat
                                    )
)
head(mvn_sample)
```

What is the observed correlation?

```{r echo = T}
cor(mvn_sample$V1, 
    mvn_sample$V2)
```
**NOTE.** We understand that `meansVector` and `covMat` are **population parameters**.

Linear regression: predict `mvn_sample$V2` from `mvn_sample$V1`:

```{r echo = T}
reg_model <- lm(V2 ~ V1,
                data = mvn_sample) 
summary(reg_model)
```
The coefficients are:

```{r echo = T}
summary_reg_model <- summary(reg_model)
summary_reg_model$coefficients
```
So the intercept is found at `-3.180016` with a standard error of `1.30138920` while the estimate of the slope is `1.883055` with a standard error of `0.08629802`; the respective t-tests against zero and the Type I Error probabilities are also reported.

Next we simulate 10,000 samples from the population parameters and each time perform a linear regression, recording the values of the parameter estimates:

```{r echo = T}
mvn_samples <- function(meansVector, covMat) {
  sample <- mvrnorm(n = 150,
                    mu = meansVector,
                    Sigma = covMat)
  return(as.data.frame(sample))
}
```

```{r echo = T}
lmSimulations <- lapply(1:10000, function(x) {
  newData <- mvn_samples(meansVector, covMat)
  model <- lm(V2 ~ V1, 
              data = newData)
  return(data.frame(intercept = coefficients(model)[1], 
                    slope = coefficients(model)[2]))
})
lmSimulations <- rbindlist(lmSimulations)
head(lmSimulations)
```

The distribution of the intercept estimates:

```{r echo = T}
ggplot(lmSimulations, 
       aes(x = intercept)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = .15, color = "black") + 
  ggtitle("Distrubution of Model Intercept") + 
  xlab('Intercept') + 
  ylab('Density') + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(panel.border = element_blank()) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5))
```
The estimated intercept from the first regression was found at `-3.180016`: no wonder the mean of this distribution falls close to three then, right?

```{r echo = T}
mean(lmSimulations$intercept)
```
The distribution of the slope estimates:

```{r echo = T}
ggplot(lmSimulations, 
       aes(x = slope)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = .15, color = "black") + 
  ggtitle("Distrubution of Model Slope") + 
  xlab('Slope') + 
  ylab('Density') + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(panel.border = element_blank()) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5))
```

```{r echo = T}
mean(lmSimulations$slope)
```
... while the initial regression estimated a slope of `1.883055`!

And what about the standard errors? Initially, their values were `1.30138920` for the intercept and `0.08629802` for the slope.
Let's see:

```{r echo = T}
sd(lmSimulations$intercept)
```

```{r echo = T}
sd(lmSimulations$slope)
```
Do you trust the Simple Linear Regression Model now? : )
**Note.** If you wonder why the `mean(lmSimulation$intercept)` is `-2.863263` while in the initial regression it was estimated to be `-3.180016`: **look at the standard errors of the model coefficients both in the initial regression, and their means obtained from numerical simulations**. 

### R Markdown

[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is what I have used to produce this beautiful Notebook. We will learn more about it near the end of the course, but if you already feel ready to dive deep, here's a book: [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide, Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, Garrett Grolemunds.](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)
