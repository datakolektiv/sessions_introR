### What do we want to do today?

Today we will introduce an idea even more powerful than the Decision Tree model to solve classification and regression problems: **the Random Forest model**. We will rely on the R package [{randomForest}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/) to train Random Forests in both classification and regression contexts. In order to understand Random Forests we will introduce some important theoretical concepts: *Bootstrap aggregating* (a.k.a. *Bagging*), *Out-of-bag (OOB) error*, and *Feature Bagging* (a.k.a. *the random subspace method* or *attribute bagging*). We will see how these approaches in Machine Learning prevent overfitting in the training of a complex model like Random Forest.


### 0. Setup

```{r echo = T, eval = F}
install.packages('randomForest')
install.packages('glmnet')
```

Grab the `HR_comma_sep.csv` dataset from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/liujiaqi/hr-comma-sepcsv) and place it in your `_data` directory for this session. We will also use the [Boston Housing Dataset:  BostonHousing.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selva86/datasets/master/BostonHousing.csv)

```{r echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
dataDir <- paste0(getwd(), "/_data/")
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(randomForest)
library(ggrepel)
```


### 1. Random Forests for Classification

We begin by loading and inspecting the `HR_comma_sep.csv` dataset:

```{r echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
dataSet <- read.csv(paste0(getwd(), "/_data/HR_comma_sep.csv"),
                    header = T,
                    check.names = 1,
                    stringsAsFactors = F)
glimpse(dataSet)
```
The task is to predict the value of `left` - whether the employee has left the company or not - from a set of predictors encompassing the following:

- **satisfaction_level**: a measure of employee's level of satisfaction
- **last_evaluation**: the result of a last evaluation
- **number_projects**: in how many projects did the employee took part
- **average_monthly_hours**: how working hours monthly on average
- **time_spend_company**: for how long is the employee with us
- **Work_accident**: any work accidents?
- **promotion_last_5years**: did the promotion occur in the last five years?
- **sales**: department (sales, accounting, hr, technical, support, management, IT, product_mng, marketing, RandD)
- **salary**: salary class (low, medium, high)


#### 1.1 Random Forests: the Algorithm

There three important concepts to understand how Random Forest builds upon Decision Trees:

![](../_img/S21_01_RandomForest.jpeg)

- **Bootstrap aggregating (Bagging).** We begin with some training set for our model, $D$. Bagging generates $m$ new training sets, $D_i$, $i = 1, 2, ..., m$, by randomly sampling from $D$ uniformly and *with replacement*. The samples obtained in this way are known as *bootstrap samples*. In Random Forests, $m$ simpler models - Decision Trees, precisely - are fitted for each $D_i$ bootstrap sample. 

- **Out-of-bag (OOB) error.** Each time a new bootstrap sample $D_i$ is produced, some data points remain *out of the bag*, are not used in model training, and form the **OOB set** (the *Out-of-bag set*). The OOB error is a *prediction error* (remember this concept from our introduction to cross-validation?) which is computed from the OOB set, where the prediction is obtained by averaging the response (in regression) or as a majority vote (in classification) from all the trees in the forest that were not trained on that particular OOB instance.

- **The Random Subspace Method (Feature Bagging).** The Random Subspace Method is a method to control for the complexity of the decision trees grown in a Random Forest model. **On each new split**, only a randomly chosen *subset of predictors* is used to find the optimal split. The Random Forests algorithm, as we will see, has a control parameter that determines how many features are randomly selected to produce a new split.  


#### 1.2 Classification w. {randomForest}

We will fit a Random Forest model to the `HR_comma_sep.csv` dataset with `randomForest::randomForest()` in R. In spite of all the precautionary measures already taken in the Random Forest model itself, we will still perform an additional *outter* k-fold cross-validation with 5 folds: better safe than sorry. 

First, define the folds:

```{r echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
dataSet$ix <- sample(1:5, dim(dataSet)[1], replace = T)
table(dataSet$ix)
```
Perform a 5-fold cross validation for a set of Random Forests across the following control parameters:

- **ntree:** the number of trees to grow
- **mtry:** the number of variables to randomly sample as candidates at each split (to control Feature Bagging)

```{r echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
ntree <- seq(250, 1000, by = 250)
mtry <- 1:(dim(dataSet)[2]-2)
# - mtry: we do not count `left` which is an outcome
# - and `ix` which is a fold index, so we have
# - dim(dataSet)[2]-2 predictors in the model.
# - start timer:
tstart <- Sys.time()
rfModels <- lapply(ntree, function(nt) {
  # - lapply() across ntree
  mtrycv <- lapply(mtry, function(mt) {
    # - lapply() across mt
    cv <- lapply(unique(dataSet$ix), function(fold) {
      # - lapply across folds:
      # - split training and test sets
      testIx <- fold
      trainIx <- setdiff(1:5, testIx)
      trainSet <- dataSet %>% 
        dplyr::filter(ix %in% trainIx) %>% 
        dplyr::select(-ix)
      testSet <- dataSet %>% 
        dplyr::filter(ix %in% testIx) %>%
        dplyr::select(-ix)
      # - `left` to factor for classification 
      # -  w. randomForest()
      trainSet$left <- as.factor(trainSet$left)
      testSet$left <- as.factor(testSet$left)
      # - Random Forest:
      model <- randomForest::randomForest(formula = left ~ .,
                                          data = trainSet, 
                                          ntree = nt,
                                          mtry = mt
                                          )
      # - ROC analysis:
      predictions <- predict(model, 
                             newdata = testSet)
      hit <- sum(ifelse(predictions == 1 & testSet$left == 1, 1, 0))
      hit <- hit/sum(testSet$left == 1)
      fa <- sum(ifelse(predictions == 1 & testSet$left == 0, 1, 0))
      fa <- fa/sum(testSet$left == 0)
      acc <- sum(predictions == testSet$left)
      acc <- acc/length(testSet$left)
      # - Output:
      return(
        data.frame(fold, hit, fa, acc)
      )
    })
    # - collect results from all folds:
    cv <- rbindlist(cv)
    # - average ROC:
    avg_roc <- data.frame(hit = mean(cv$hit),
                          fa = mean(cv$fa), 
                          acc = mean(cv$acc),
                          mtry = mt)
    return(avg_roc)
  })
  # - collect from all mtry values:
  mtrycv <- rbindlist(mtrycv)
  # - add ntree and out:
  mtrycv$ntree <- nt
  return(mtrycv)
})
# - collect all results
rfModels <- rbindlist(rfModels)
write.csv(rfModels, 
          paste0(getwd(), "/rfModels.csv"))
# - Report timing:
print(paste0("The estimation took: ", 
             difftime(Sys.time(), tstart, units = "mins"), 
             " minutes."))
```

```{r echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
print(rfModels)
```

Let's inspect the CV results visually. Accuracy first:

```{r echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
rfModels$ntree <- factor(rfModels$ntree)
rfModels$mtry <- factor(rfModels$mtry)
ggplot(data = rfModels, 
       aes(x = mtry,
           y = acc, 
           group = ntree, 
           color = ntree,
           fill = ntree,
           label = round(acc, 2))
       ) +
  geom_path(size = .25) + 
  geom_point(size = 1.5) + 
  ggtitle("Random Forests CV: Accuracy") +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(panel.border = element_blank()) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5, size = 8))
```

Hit rate:

```{r echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
ggplot(data = rfModels, 
       aes(x = mtry,
           y = hit, 
           group = ntree, 
           color = ntree,
           fill = ntree,
           label = round(acc, 2))
       ) +
  geom_path(size = .25) + 
  geom_point(size = 1.5) + 
  ggtitle("Random Forests CV: Hit Rate") +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(panel.border = element_blank()) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5, size = 8))
```
False Alarm rate:

```{r echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
ggplot(data = rfModels, 
       aes(x = mtry,
           y = fa, 
           group = ntree, 
           color = ntree,
           fill = ntree,
           label = round(acc, 2))
       ) +
  geom_path(size = .25) + 
  geom_point(size = 1.5) + 
  ggtitle("Random Forests CV: FA Rate") +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(panel.border = element_blank()) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5, size = 8))
```

And pick the best model from ROC:

```{r echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
rfModels$diff <- rfModels$hit - rfModels$fa
w_best <- which.max(rfModels$diff)
rfModels[w_best, ]
```

And we can still refine the chosen model:

```{r echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
dataSet <- dataSet %>% 
  dplyr::select(-ix)
dataSet$left <- factor(dataSet$left)
optimal_model <- randomForest::randomForest(formula = left ~ .,
                                            data = dataSet,
                                            ntree = 250,
                                            mtry = 4)
optimal_model$importance
```

The cumulative OOB error up to the i-th tree can be found in the first column of the `optimal_model$err.rate` field:

```{r echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
head(optimal_model$err.rate)
```
Let's take a closer look at it:

```{r echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
oobFrame <- as.data.frame(optimal_model$err.rate)
oobFrame$ntree <- 1:dim(oobFrame[1])
ggplot(data = oobFrame, 
       aes(x = ntree,
           y = OOB)) + 
  geom_path(size = .25) + 
  geom_point(size = 1.5) + 
  ggtitle("Cumulative OOB error from the CV optimal Random Forest model") +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(panel.border = element_blank()) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5, size = 8))
```

We can observe how the cumulative OOB error stabilizes following the growth of a certain number of trees in the Random Forest model:

```{r echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
w_tree <- which.min(oobFrame$OOB)
print(w_tree)
```
And finally:

```{r echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
optimal_model <- randomForest::randomForest(formula = left ~ .,
                                            data = dataSet,
                                            ntree = w_tree,
                                            mtry = 4
                                            )
predictions <- predict(optimal_model, 
                       newdata = dataSet)
hit <- sum(ifelse(predictions == 1 & dataSet$left == 1, 1, 0))
hit <- hit/sum(dataSet$left == 1)
fa <- sum(ifelse(predictions == 1 & dataSet$left == 0, 1, 0))
fa <- fa/sum(dataSet$left == 0)
acc <- sum(predictions == dataSet$left)
acc <- acc/length(dataSet$left)
print(paste0("Accuracy: ", acc, "; Hit rate: ", hit, "; FA rate: ", fa))
```

### 2. Random Forests for Regression

In {randomForest}, to obtain the Random Forest model for regression **simply do not pronounce an outcome to be a factor**.
We will use the Boston Housing dataset to demonstrate.

```{r echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
dataSet <- read.csv(paste0('_data/', 'BostonHousing.csv'), 
                    header = T, 
                    check.names = F,
                    stringsAsFactors = F)
head(dataSet)
```

Here are the variables:

+ **crim**: per capita crime rate by town
+ **zn**: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
+ **indus**: proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
+ **chas**: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
+ **nox**: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
+ **rm**: average number of rooms per dwelling
+ **age**: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
+ **dis**: weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
+ **rad**: index of accessibility to radial highways
+ **tax**: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
+ **ptratio**: pupil-teacher ratio by town
+ **b**: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
+ **lstat**: % lower status of the population
+ **medv**: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's

The `medv` variable is the *outcome*.

Random Forest (no cross-validation this time):

```{r echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
rfRegMsodel <- randomForest::randomForest(formula = medv ~ .,
                                          data = dataSet,
                                          ntree = 1000,
                                          mtry = 7
                                          )
```

We can use the generic `plot()` function to assess how the MSE changes across `ntree`:

```{r echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
plot(rfRegMsodel)
```

```{r echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
predictions <- predict(rfRegMsodel, 
                       newdata = dataSet)
predictFrame <- data.frame(predicted_medv = predictions, 
                           observed_medv = dataSet$medv)
ggplot(data = predictFrame, 
       aes(x = predicted_medv,
           y = observed_medv)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", size = .25, color = "red") + 
  geom_point(size = 1.5, color = "black") + 
  geom_point(size = .75, color = "white") +
  ggtitle("Random Forest in Regression: Observed vs Predicted\nBoston Housing Dataset") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(panel.border = element_blank()) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5, size = 8))
```
